# Puanmatik
I’ve created an simple front-end program with Angular-Ionic. It calculates the TYT(first university
entering exam in Turkey) score with student’s net score by course .Students can record them with buttons that I’ve created.
According to specific total score, the program determines whether you enough for the taking next exam or not.
The program is in Turkish language.

As you can see in the first picture the student've entered his/her net scores.The program calculated the total score and determined and also make comment as "Insufficient" because score is under the specific score.

If you look the second picture , the other student've also entered his/her net scores.The program calculated the total score and determined and also make comment "Congratulations" because score is above the specific score.
